# Card-Game-Analysis
A Python project where you can play go fish and then have the results of the game(s) be graphed out for you with plotly.
The Go Fish game is made using Objected Oriented Programming in making classes for the cards, card decks, and players.
The player can play go fish themselves or have the computer play itself 1 or 100 times to get a solid dataset to graph.
